# Taint-FM Discord Bot

Taint-FM is a Discord bot that provides YouTube audio playback functionality. It supports queuing YouTube videos (or playlists), downloading the audio locally before playing (to avoid streaming issues), and managing playback with commands to join voice channels, skip tracks, view the queue, and more. Any downloaded audio is removed post song completion or skip.

## Features

- **Join**: The bot joins your current voice channel.
- **Play**: Queue a YouTube video or playlist for playback. The bot downloads the audio locally, queues it, and plays it from your voice channel.
- **Skip**: Skip the currently playing track.
- **Queue**: Display the list of tracks in the queue.
- **Clear**: Clear the entire playback queue.
- **Leave**: Disconnect the bot from the voice channel.
